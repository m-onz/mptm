## Stage 1: recon

### Map the application content

* explore and spider the application
* browse with javascript disabled
* create an account if there is one
* monitor requests and responses
* identify explore content found by spidering

### Consult public resources

* use internet search engines and archives (way back machine).
* use google dorks
* perform more searches using discovered info and emails
* review published WSDL files 

### Discover default content

* run nikto to detect any well known content
* verify interesting findings manually
* request the servers root directory using IP and run nikto against IP and server name
* make a request to the server using various user agents headers

### Enumerate identifier-specified functions

* identify identifier specified functions like /admin.jsp?action=editUser
* apply content discovery techniques to those parameters
* identify interesting scripts and queries and third party components

### Map the attack surface

* try to ascertain the likely internal structure and functionality of the server side application
* for each type of functionality identify common vulnerabilities that effect them.
* formulate a plan of attack based on the most interesting findings
